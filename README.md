# Spiral

v 2.5.0

-------------------------------------------------
## UPDATE 5/24/19

Nodemailer does not allow for multiple emails to be sent out as it requires certain attributes to be present (such as SendMail variable) and obviously you cannot have duplicate references.

Scope has changed.

To use Spiral we will create both an inbound (company) and outbound (client) Firebase Project.
